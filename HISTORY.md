```
(maint) Do not flatten answers

When generating meep 2.0 answers.

Changes in version20162.rb took an answers structure like:

:answers
  puppet_enterprise:
    profile:
      "master::foo": bar

and produce a pe.conf with

"puppet_enterprise::profile::master::foo": "bar"

This might be a convenience for some kinds of parameter listing, but
breaks your ability to submit actually structured data such as:

:answers
  feature_flags:
    pe_modules_next: true

Where feature_flags is supposed to be a hash, and not a parameter.

This pr takes the approach of just fixing new behavior in Glisan, when
using Meep 2.0 format (pe-modules-next), but it might be better to
change the behavior altogether, although this is a breaking change for
anyone relying on the previous 'helpful' collapsing of answer elements.

This commit ensures that when windows is a platform on a host we return

(PE-19203,PE-17621) Generate a meep 2.0 format based on version flag

Previously there was a hard version break set on PE 2017.1 which would
produce a 2.0 format pe.conf, but since we've had to back out meep
classification in Flanders, this needs to change.

Added a PeConf object to generate 1.0 and 2.0 format files based on a
meep_schema_version flag. It defaults to the original 1.0 format. It
will be up to beaker-pe to submit this flag in the beaker options based
on its use_meep_for_classification?() test.

There is one change to the 1.0 hiera_host_config implementation in that
it no longer uses answer_for to set the master, db, console settings. I
don't think this matters because there are no defaults for these
settings, and beaker answer overrides are merged afterwards in
generate_hiera_config() regardless.

(PE-17621) Generate node_roles in 2017.1+ pe_conf

MEEP 2.0 introduces a node_roles hash in pe.conf for classification.
This supercedes using the puppet_enterprise host parameters as a de
facto classification.  The Version20171 class maps existing beaker role
aliases to the new role strings used for classification in pe.conf.

So, from a MEEP 1.0 version pe.conf such as:

  {
    "puppet_enterprise::puppet_master_host": "master.net"
    "puppet_enterprise::puppetdb_host": "puppetdb.net"
    "puppet_enterprise::console_host": "console.net"
  }

You now have a 2.0 version that looks like:

  {
    "node_roles": {
      "pe_role::split::primary_master": ["master.net"]
      "pe_role::split::puppetdb": ["puppetdb.net"]
      "pe_role::split::console": ["console.net"]
    }
  }

This commit changes the q_puppetdb_hostname answer to be the hostname of
the puppetdb node instead of its ip address which is returned by the

to changes introduced in Puppet 4.4, the puppet_enterprsie module no
longer needs all host parameters in a monolithic install case.
This commit updates the generation to match what the module has changed
to use. For a monolithic install, the only required answers are now the
console admin password, and puppet_master_host. for split installs with
PE postgres, just master, console and puppetdb host.

(PE-14996) Ensure flatten_keys_to_joined_string generates strings

Prior to this commit I didn't ensure that keys being given in hashes
to `flatten_keys_to_joined_string` were being converted to strings.
This would result in keys that were passed in as symbols acting as a
duplicate key to the string equivalent, which were then written out
by the json/hocon parsers because it seems they do not have a uniqueness
constraint on keys in hashes.
This commit changes `flatten_keys_to_joined_string` to always convert
the keys to strings, which should prevent this sort of duplicate key
issue.

(PE-15259) Only include legacy database user defaults if prompted

If beaker-pe initializes BeakerAnswers with an

upgrading from a pre-meep Beaker install of PE where BeakerAnswers
changed the default user names.

Setting the old legacy database password defaults is never required.

Fixes a spec failure that occurred from

define hashes of expected values so we don't miss any changes

codes expected constants so that we don't have false positives from both
expectations and results coming indirectly from internal code references and

testing for literal strings, as opposed to just ensuring the calculation

(PE-14996) Guard addition of database_name, database_user by upgrade

BeakerAnswers historically sets database user/name to non default
values.  Typically a user will not do this, and it complicates our
default workflow and subsequent upgrades.  For meep, with this commit,
I'm ignoring the database name/user settings if we're not upgrading.
The reason they are needed on upgrade (currently only from pre-meep
versions), is that a legacy install laid down by Beaker will have these
database settings, and we have to have them in pe.conf when upgrading,
or database access fails.

When upgrading from a meep install (2016.2.1+), a pe.conf should not be
created, and beaker-pe should just call the installer-shim with no
pe.conf file. https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PE-15351

(PE-14996) Treat q_puppetdb_database_password default same as others

181305f6ba6116d05c8163eb2a18243df30098d0 changed beaker-answers so that
the puppetdb default was referenced by its answer
q_puppetdb_database_password, rather than the key q_puppetdb_password,
which is not used in the legacy answer file.  Due to how answer_for()
works, where an existing value looked up from DEFAULTS prevents the
passed default override from being used, this caused the generated
answer for puppetdb to added without quotes. To fix this, quotes were
added to the default.  This worked, but it ran counter to how the later
database answers for classifier, rbac, activity and orchestrator
database passwords were handled.  These had defaults without quotes, and
then explicitly quoted the derived answers generated for the
answers_hash.

When we began using answers for generating a hiera config for meep, this
caused problems with the puppetdb password because the quotes in the
puppetdb default ended up in the json value, causing an error in
Postgres.

To fix this, and to unify q_puppetdb_database_password's handling with
that of the other db passwords, this commit removes the quoting in the
defaults, and adds it to the generation of the final
q_puppetdb_database_password answer.  It also modified a spec that was
testing the generation of this answer to take into account that the
quotes are added by the answer generation process.

where legacy answers are provided to be slurped into Beaker options and

because the test was assuming strings for keys instead of symbols.  The
patch converts to string before testing and adds a spec.

(PE-14996) Provide a format agnostic method for configuration string

With the changes in installer configuration format, Version201620 now
has an answer_hiera method.  However the component using beaker-answers
shouldn't have to care about which output method it calls to get a
configuration.  Ultimately it should just expect the correct
configuration for a given PE version.  To assist with this, this commit
adds an installer_configuration_string(host) method which will return
either an answer file string or a hiera pe.conf string depending on the
:format setting.

Because no version prior to 2016.2.0 can work with a hiera pe.conf, I've
moved the implementation into Version201620 and left an erroring stub in
Answers.

(PE-14996) Use :format in options instead of @type as param

Prior to this commit I was adding a type param to the init/create
methods of `Answers` in order to specify which answers file type
to generate. Using the word type, which is already used to specify
`:install` vs `:upgrade`, and creating a whole new param were
somewhat counter-intuitive and confusing.

This commit removes the type param, and instead reads the `:format`
key from the `options` hash upon initialization, and if it cannot find
a value at that key, it will default to `:bash`. I went back to using
`:format` in order to reduce the chance of us later being confused
by the `:type` option and decided to use the options hash because that
is how we have typically interacted with the `Answers` library in the
past. This should hopefully be a more intuitive and less error prone
way of interacting with the library. Fingers crossed.

(PE-14996) Use case for determining answer type

Prior to this commit we were using a series of if statements

This commit changes those checks to use a case statement in order
to clean up the logic. Additionally, more exceptions will be raised
if methods are called with an unknown `type`.

we can re-use those libraries elsewhere without needing to require
them.

(PE-14996) Further refactor default config generation

Prior to this commit there was a large amount of duplicate code
used for getting the `answer_for` for each key.

This commit refactors that duplicate code out into a method on
the Answers class that takes an array of desired defaults and
returns an array with either the default from the Answers class
or the user-provider override.

Additionally, instead of them hiera answers, we should be calling
them hiera config in order to be consistent with how we are documenting
them and what they really are; persistent configuration that will be
saved on the system.

(PE-14996) Abstract bash vs hiera answer generation logic

Prior to this commit the bash and hiera answer generation logic were
all crammed into the `generate_answers` method on 20162.
This commit abstracts the bash and hiera answer generation logic into
two separate methods: `generate_bash_answers` and
`generate_hiera_answers`. This should make the answers generation a
little easier to follow.

(PE-14996) Add DB user/name to default hiera configs

Prior to this commit we were not specifying the old default
DB user/names in the hiera configs, which could result in tests
that depend on those names to fail. Additionally, it is a good
idea to verify that specifying a non-default database name still
works.
This commit specifies puppetdb, classifier, activity, rbac and
orchestrator database names by default for the 2016.2 hiera
config/answer files. console/console_auth are omitted because
those databases are deprecated in 2016.2.

Also fixed a typo where `q_database_name` was specified in the
defaults hash instead of `q_classifier_database_name` and fixed
the only reference to that (from 3.4).

(BKR-763) Supply only necessary answers on upgrade

Previous to this commit, answer files were generated in full during
upgrade scenarios; this does not match the user workflow or what is
documented for upgrades, so we should only supply answers needed. The
answers `create` method now checks the `:type` in options and creates a
separate branch of `Answers` named `Upgrade`.

This change only affects PE 3.8 and higher; all lower versions will
continue to produce an entire answers file.
