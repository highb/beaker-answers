# beaker-answers

beaker-answers is a beaker library that constructs answer files for Puppet
Enterprise installation.

# Documentation

- [Rubydocs](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/puppetlabs/beaker-answers) contain the
technical reference for APIs and other aspects of beaker-answers. They describe
how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of
key concepts.

# Release

To release a new version, we use a
[Jenkins job](https://jenkins-qe.delivery.puppetlabs.net/job/qe_beaker-answers_btc-rls/)
(access to internal infrastructure will be required to view job).

To release a new version (from the master branch), you'll need to just provide
a new beaker-answers version number to the job, and you're off to the races.
